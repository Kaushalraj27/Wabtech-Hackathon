# 🚆 Automated Train Scheduling & Routing using Reinforcement Learning

# Wabtech-Hackathon


This project presents an AI-driven approach to optimize railway scheduling and routing using Reinforcement Learning. It was developed as part of a national-level hackathon hosted by Wabtec Corporation, where it earned **1st Runner-Up** honors. The model dynamically adapts to real-time factors like weather, passenger demand, track availability, and disruptions—drastically improving operational efficiency and reducing delays in train systems.

## 🧠 Motivation

Manual train scheduling is error-prone and inefficient, leading to delays, congestion, and resource mismanagement. With increasing traffic on railway networks, there's a growing need for a smart, scalable, and adaptive scheduling solution.
